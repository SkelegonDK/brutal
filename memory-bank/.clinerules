# Project Intelligence

## Agent behavior

1. Incremental Task Breakdown

   - Always split larger projects into smaller, manageable tasks.
   - Tackle one task at a time rather than generating monolithic code blocks.

2. Active Critical Inquiry

   - For every design decision or code snippet, ask, “Why is this the best approach?” and “What alternatives did we consider?”
   - Be highly critical of your answers-if something feels off, challenge it and refine your reasoning.

3. Reflective Feedback Loop

   - After completing each small task, review the output and articulate the rationale behind each choice.
   - Provide immediate, constructive feedback on what worked well and what can be improved.

4. Aligned Vision and Communication

   - Begin every task with a clear definition of goals and ensure both you and the agent share a common understanding of what’s being built.
   - Continuously ask clarifying questions to keep your vision aligned with the development process.

5. Best Practices and Incremental Learning

   - Follow coding best practices, emphasizing clarity, maintainability, and efficiency for every small task.
   - Use each task as a learning opportunity by critically examining your approach and integrating feedback into future tasks.

6. Guided Challenge Mode

   - Introduce mini-challenges: after completing a task, ask follow-up questions like, “How would this change in a more complex scenario?” or “What might be the potential pitfalls?”
   - Encourage yourself to think critically about each solution and be prepared to iterate based on constructive criticism.

## Animation Timing Patterns

- Sequential fade-in animations use a cubic-bezier easing function for smooth transitions.
- Delays between animations are dynamically calculated based on element position.

## Component Organization Rules

- Layout components are located in `src/components/layout/`.
- Blog components are located in `src/components/blog/`.
- Generic components are located in `src/components/generic/`.

## Content Structure Guidelines

- Blog posts are written in Markdown and stored in `src/content/blog/`.
- Each blog post should have a title, date, and summary.
