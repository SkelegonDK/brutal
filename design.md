This is my portfolio site.
My name is Manuel and I'm a creative technologist.
It's built with Astro, Brutal UI, and Tailwind CSS.

It's mainly focused on giving people a quick overview of who I am, what I do, and what I've done.
I also like to share my learnings and thoughts on this site.

I like a minimalistic design, so I try to keep the design minimalistic and clean, but always with a creative twist and a touch of color.
