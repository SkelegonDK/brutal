# Elevenlabs' Alchemy

I tend to call Elevenlabs voice-over alchemy.

As interest peaks in voice generation, especially with the release of the multiple realtime voice generation APIs. 
Still, Elevenlabs keeps the lead when it comes to quality and availability. All by extrapolating meaning from context.
However, the inner workings of working expressively with text-to-speech tools is still a bit of like ALCHEMY. Half magic, half science. More often than not, different from on to the next. Despite Googles efforts to standardize it with the industry leading [SSML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_Synthesis_Markup_Language).

But that does not seem to happen. AI tools in general are becoming more verbose and complex.
Meaning that they can do more and more by themselves, but also that to know and understand what's happening it requires a deeper understanding of human nature and linguistics.

If you are new and interested in voice generation, practice. Learn the intricacies of a specific voice and it's limitations.
Make a compelling script for and ad or a movie scene,
