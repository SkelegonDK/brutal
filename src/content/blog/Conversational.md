# Orders of magnitude

On a typical week, there always some technology that I'm excited about.
This week has been, CRAZY! New open source models, new tools, new APIs and new techniques to make more interesting content.
Despite ALL of that, this week it's the release of Elevenlabs' Conversational AI.

Elevenlabs' Conversational AI is awesome. It's simple to use and set up, but leaves all the doors open to make both complex but also simple.
