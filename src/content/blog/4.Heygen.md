## Best in class avatars and voices

![AR Showrooms](./Heygen.png)

One of my latest ventures has been working with Heygen. In a market flooded with copycat products and services, one of the most challenging tasks I face daily is demonstrating the true value of AI tools and products. Heygen stands out by offering the best synthetic avatars, providing a clear and compelling value proposition.

Heygen combines top-tier voice synthesis with these avatars, enabling users to create powerful and impactful messages through synthetic video. This technology opens up new possibilities for communication, making it easier for businesses to convey their messages effectively.

Heygen’s main appeal is in creating advanced video and voice translations. I have had great success taking videos and using Heygen to translate them, even preserving people’s voices, energy, and most importantly, their intent. This makes the content more accessible and relatable to millions of people around the world.

Key Responsibilities

- Video translation and dubbing
- Creating production workflows

Video Translation and Dubbing

To ensure accuracy, I work closely with linguists and, at the very least, native speakers, especially for languages I am completely new to. This collaboration is essential for maintaining the integrity and cultural relevance of the translated content.

Developing Production Workflows

Over the years, I’ve created numerous workflows for new, cutting-edge products. I started my career on the production side in various fields, so I have a deep understanding of how creative production works. Given my expertise, particularly in music production, I’ve been able to explain my methods and processes to both stakeholders and creatives. This has allowed me to quickly create processes, even though I am often at the forefront of these developments.
