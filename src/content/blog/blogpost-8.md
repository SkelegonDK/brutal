## AR Showrooms

![AR Showrooms](/showcase_low.png)

Synthesia Studio creates state of the art personal avatars for businesses and education. On top of that they have a platform that allows you to create your own videos with your avatar. You can also translate automatically to many languages and scale your content production in minutes.
I've been working with Synthesia Studio for around 4 years now, creating videos for big clients, helping with the localisation processes of those videos, and now creating production workflows that can scale to thousands of videos.

Tasks:

- Create videos for clients
- Create production workflows
- Create localisation workflows
- Creating guidelines for Custom Avatars
