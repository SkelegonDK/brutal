## Finding the right voice

![AR Showrooms](./Elevenlabs.png)

One of my longest ventures has been with the Elevenlabs platform, which specializes in creating custom voice models for businesses. Their platform allows users to create their own unique voice models and use them to generate audio. This technology can be utilized for a variety of applications, with the most common being brand voice creation for marketing, customer service, and personal use.

Through years of work and exploration, I have developed a solid understanding of the technology and the industry’s needs. Both avatars and voices are deeply personal and unique; I would even call them “superpersonal.”

For avatars to feel authentic and relatable, their voices need to be slightly amplified versions of themselves—real but not too perfect. This journey led me to consult with experts across various fields, including linguistics, psychology, acting, and directing, to truly understand what makes a voice and character feel genuine.

As much as we think of Synthetic Voice Over as something that “just comes out of generative AI,” the process is very similar to recording any other kind of talent. People need to be prepared and directed in a certain way to be the best version of themselves when recorded. Apart from that, it’s crucial to understand the linguistic aspect of creating recordings that have the necessary “vocabulary” for the specific purpose of the voice model.

Often, the hardest part is nailing the linguistics and tone of voice, as it can be very subjective. Therefore, I had to learn to understand and apply feedback, regardless of the language. Sometimes, just knowing who to ask is the most important thing.

### Key Responsibilities

- Creating custom voice models
- Directing talent for voice models
- Developing production workflows

### Developing Production Workflows

Over the years, I’ve created numerous workflows for new, cutting-edge products. I started my career on the production side in various fields, so I have a deep understanding of how creative production works. Given my expertise, particularly in music production, I’ve been able to explain my methods and processes to both stakeholders and creatives. This has allowed me to quickly create processes, even though I am often at the forefront of these developments.

### Staying Updated with Advancements

Part of staying up to date is through the actual work. You never truly understand something until you have to implement it. Beyond that, I rely on YouTube, audiobooks, and occasionally scientific papers to keep my knowledge current.
