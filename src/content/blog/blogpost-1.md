# About me üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Hey there! I'm **Manuel**,

I'm a versatile and curious person by trade. I 've always been naturally drawn to new and improved technology and processes. I love systems and I love creative people. Even while studying as a web developer I could not let my creative side go. So I made it my mission to find ways to use software to improve my creative work and have software breathe new life into boring and tedious creative processes.

In my free time, you'll catch me nerding out in Blender, watchin AI news and discussion or occasionally, at a local game jam.

If you have an intriguing idea for an AI, AR, or 3D project, I'd love to hear about it! I'm always up for a challenge and eager to collaborate with like-minded people who share my enthusiasm for innovation.
