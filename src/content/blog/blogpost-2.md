Dell Technologies is a global leader in IT infrastructure and services. Working for a global brand requires a global mindset and consistency at every level. I worked on a variety of projects for Dell, including email, video and banner work. Mainly with technocally complex tasks, but always wheighing in on creative side when it's relevant.

### Tasks

- Email development and extensive testing for global markets.
- Video editing and animation for internal and external use.
- Banner development and testing for global markets.
- Technical support for internal and external stakeholders.
- Trouble shooting and bug fixing for internal and external stakeholders.
