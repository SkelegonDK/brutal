## Dashboard

![Dashboard](/dashboard.png)

Streamlit brings new life  and interactive features to excel sheets. I worked on a dashboard for a client, that needed a way to manage and secure their data. The dashboard is built with Streamlit and Python, and is hosted on AWS EC2. The dashboard is connected to a S3 bucket, where the data is stored. The dashboard is secured with a login system, that allows users to access the dashboard and data. The dashboard is also connected to a database, where the user data is stored.

### Tasks

- Secure user and data management for prerelease assets
- Integration with AWS EC2 and S3 buckets
- Fullstack development with Streamlit & Python
